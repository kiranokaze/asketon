made cool status script from many other quest-scripts. now it shows me continiously calendar, time, statuses that i've added. and the cool part that they are progressive, numbers are growing

May 28  [23:50]
wow, it was huge amount of new info for just evening, now i'm familiar with grep sed commands, also wc -l espessaly for my needs. and now i have nice a.k.a. minimalist's rpg to play with. recode cal inside of status.sh and now it is just date with my formatting. looks pretty nice, but when i'm looking at the code.. damn, ami a real programmer now? at least its feels like this

May 29  [03:35]
wow, what was that, whole mini project on almost 100 lines of code. tips.sh counts my tips in month, dumping final number every last day of month to separate file and don't do that whyle i'm resetting to not reset the dump too. also second tries if i type not numbers to add field
